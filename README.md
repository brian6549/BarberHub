# BarberHub
Barbershop appointment app
How to run:
This app can be run using XCode iPhone simulator and is available on the ios app store as well --> https://apps.apple.com/us/app/barberhub/id1462580637

There are multiple types of users that can sign in to the app:

The sign-in information provided is for the beauty salon. Tap on it and hit login to logon as a manager or employee of the salon.

To sign in as a manager, use these credentials:
email: manager@manager.com password: manager12345

The manager can remove or add employees. When employees are added, appointments cannot be made with them immediately because I link their valid square account to the app afterward when they provide it. Sign in to the provided employee account before attempting to remove it to see how they can cancel appointments that are made with them.

To sign in as an employee of the salon, use these credentials(also provided in the sign-in information):
email: test89@test.com password: test12345

an employee can view their appointments and edit their profile information

to sign up as an employee, tap sign up and enter 'AnotherBarbershopId' when it prompts for a sign up code.

Alternatively, you can create new manager and employee accounts by following the instructions in the app.
